# UniversityGui

This is a dummy project when playing around java and git for the first months.

Project used to learn java and jframe elements.

Based on the project I continued from java classes in UniWA.

Try the executable jar file : [right here](https://github.com/VaggM/UniversityGui/blob/main/UniversityGUI.jar).

The current version of the project works around a main window frame from which you are handling a 'University'.

Things you can do :

* add students, teachers, subjects and departments within it with their own variables.

* read any objects you had previously created from text log files that are updated as you progress.

* list anything saved to view it with an option to edit or delete

* put everything in alphabetical order (subjects are also in order by semester)

* clear any objects of one type saved, as well as its text log file

* you can view a general log file showing all the objects you created in any session of using the app

* clear everything
